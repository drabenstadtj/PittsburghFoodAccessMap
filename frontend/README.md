# TODO
- ~~Fix date formatting in Resource Card (currently doesnt format -- military time)~~
- ~~fix chip border and radius (formatting nonexistent minus green background)~~
- mobile searching view is broken (results arent displayed, only filtered: unintuitive)
- Get missing hours for resources 
- Implement reporting (doesn't exist at all currently)
- either go through and tag all entries with neighborhood when importing or calculate it on the fly with geojson and the pittsburgh dataset 
- filtering and category mapping ignores convenience stores currently
- low prio: break out mobile and desktop views into separate components
